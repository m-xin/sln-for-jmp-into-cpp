/*
This code provides the basic structure for a poker game, including:

Defining the card suit and rank enumerations, as well as a Card struct to represent a single card.
A getCardName function to display the name of a card.
Functions to create a standard 52-card deck, shuffle the deck, and deal a hand of 5 cards.
A placeholder evaluateHand function that needs to be implemented to determine the strength of the player's hand.
The main function creates and shuffles the deck, deals a hand to the player, and displays the player's initial hand. The next step would be to implement the functionality to allow the player to choose new cards and then evaluate the final hand strength.

Compared to the slot machine problem, implementing a full poker game is more complex because you need to:

Manage a deck of cards and ensure that each card is only used once.
Implement the logic to evaluate the hand strength, which involves identifying the different poker hand combinations (pair, two pair, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, straight flush, royal flush).
Potentially add additional features like betting, multiple players, and more.
Overall, the poker game implementation is more involved than the slot machine problem, but it provides a more engaging and realistic gaming experience.
