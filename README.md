This repo is used to provide the coding solution for the coding questions in "Jumping Into C++" by Alex Allain (ISBN 978-0-9889278-0-3)

There are a couple of reminders here when you are reviewing the solutions in this repo:
1. There is no best solution but better ones for the questions.
2. Please use the solution as a reference to inspire your own, rather than the standard keys.
3. Non-commercial usage, please.
4. If you find any errors or better solutions, please share them with the whole community.
